# sa-qaoa-number-partitioning
 
Number partitioning - also referred to as the number bi-partitioning problem, or the 2-partition problem - is one of Karpâ€™s original NP-hard problems, and can be stated as follows. We have a set S of n numbers, and the goal of the optimisation problem is separate them into two disjoint subsets S1 and S2 such that the difference of the sums of the
two subsets is minimised.
