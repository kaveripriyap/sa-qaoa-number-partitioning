# Solving the Number Partitioning Problem with Simulated Annealing and QAOA

## The Number Partitioning Problem

Number partitioning - also referred to as the number bi-partitioning problem, or the 2-partition problem - is one of Karpâ€™s original NP-hard problems, and can be stated as follows. We have a set S of n numbers, and the goal of the optimisation problem is separate them into two disjoint subsets S1 and S2 such that the difference of the sums of the
two subsets is minimised. 

For example, if ```S = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}```, then one possible partition would be ```S1 = {4, 8}``` and ```S2 = {5, 6, 7}```. The sums of
these two subsets are 12 and 18 respectively, giving a difference of 6. The optimal solution is ```S1 = {4, 5, 6}```, ```S2 = {7, 8}```,
since the sum of both of these subsets is 15, and hence the difference is zero.
